# Project README

## Project Overview
The Smart_Pits project is an IOT based project that aims to increase the ground water level by collecting rainwater and includes safety precautions for children around pits. This README file documents the development process, encountered errors, and their respective solutions.

## Development Process
1. Initial idea conceptualization
2. Planning and research
3. Hardware selection and setup
4. Coding and testing

## Encountered Errors and Solutions
1. **Error**: Infrared sensor not detecting properly
   **Solution**: Adjusted the positioning and sensitivity of the sensor.

2. **Error**: Rainfall detection not registering accurately
   **Solution**: Checked and replaced faulty rain sensors.

3. **Error**: Buzzer not producing sound
   **Solution**: Rewired the connection and replaced the buzzer.

## Functionality Errors and Solutions
1. **Error**: Green LED not turning on even when rainfall is detected
   **Cause**: Incorrect pin assignment in the code
   **Solution**: Updated the code with the correct pin assignment.

2. **Error**: Servo motor not responding to rainfall and person detection
   **Cause**: Incorrect logic in the code
   **Solution**: Reworked the servo control logic to properly respond to sensor inputs.

3. **Error**: Blue LED flickers intermittently 
   **Cause**: Power supply instability
   **Solution**: Changed the power source and stabilized the power supply.
